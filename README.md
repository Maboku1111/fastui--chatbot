# ChatbotFastUI

Here's a brief overview of the imported libraries:

- fastapi and starlette for building the API
- fastui for creating user interfaces
- mistralai for chat completion and AI-related tasks
- pinecone and sentence_transformers for vector database and sentence embeddings
- pydantic for data modeling
- decouple for configuration management
- os for environment variable access
- asyncio for asynchronous programming

Below is an of the several components that were initialized:

- pc is an instance of the Pinecone class with an API key retrieved from the environment variable "PINECONE_API_KEY".
- An index named "index0" with a dimension of 1536 and using the "euclidean" metric is created using pc.Index("index0").
- model is initialized with the SentenceTransformer model 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2'.
- An instance of FastAPI named app is created.
- app.message_history is initialized as an empty list to store message history.

The MessageHistoryModel class is a data model that represents a message in a chat history. It has a single field called message of type str. The Field function is used to specify additional metadata for the field, such as a title.
The ChatForm class is another data model that represents a chat form. It has a single field called chat of type str. The Field function is used to specify additional metadata for the field, such as a title and a maximum length of 1000 characters.

There is a FastAPI route handler function that handles GET requests to the root endpoint '/api/'. It returns a list of components that make up the UI of a chatbot application. The UI consists of a page with a title, a description, a table to display chat history, a form to input new messages, a link to reset the chat, and a div to display the chatbot's response. The chat history is stored in the app.message_history list, which is cleared if the reset parameter is set to True. The response_model parameter specifies that the response should be serialized as a FastUI object, and response_model_exclude_none=True means that any fields with a value of None will be excluded from the serialized response.

This code defines a route /api/sse/{prompt} for an API endpoint using the FastAPI framework. When a GET request is made to this endpoint, the sse_ai_response function is executed.

Inside the function, it checks if the prompt parameter is empty or equal to 'None'. If it is, it returns a StreamingResponse with the result of calling the empty_response function. Otherwise, it returns a StreamingResponse with the result of calling the ai_response_generator function.

The SSE endpoint defines a route `/api/sse/{prompt}` for an API endpoint using the FastAPI framework. When a GET request is made to this endpoint, the `sse_ai_response` function is executed. Inside the function, it checks if the `prompt` parameter is empty or equal to `'None'`. If it is, it returns a `StreamingResponse` with the result of calling the `empty_response` function. Otherwise, it returns a `StreamingResponse` with the result of calling the `ai_response_generator` function. The `StreamingResponse` is used to stream data in a continuous manner, typically for real-time updates. The `media_type` parameter is set to `'text/event-stream'` to indicate that the response will be streamed as a series of events.

There is an asynchronous function that generates an empty response to a request. It creates a FastUI object with an empty Markdown component, serializes it to JSON, and sends it as a message. It then enters a loop where it continues to send the same message every 10 seconds to prevent the browser from reconnecting. The function returns an asynchronous iterable of strings, which can be used to stream the response to the client.
